# Project: Chatbot Development with IBM Cloud Watson Assistant

## Phase 1: Problem Definition and Design Thinking

### Problem Definition:

The project's objective is to create a chatbot using IBM Cloud Watson Assistant, functioning as a virtual guide on messaging platforms such as Facebook Messenger and Slack. The chatbot's primary tasks include providing helpful information, answering FAQs, and delivering a friendly conversational experience. The project scope encompasses designing the chatbot's persona, configuring responses, integrating with messaging platforms, and ensuring a seamless user experience.

### Design Thinking:

#### 1. Persona Design:

- **Name:** The chatbot will be named "InfoGuide," reflecting its purpose as an informative virtual assistant.

- **Tone and Style:** The tone will be friendly and informative, striking a balance between professionalism and approachability to cater to a diverse user base.

#### 2. User Scenarios:

- **FAQ Identification:**
  - What services does InfoGuide provide?
  - How can I get started with InfoGuide?
  - Can InfoGuide assist with troubleshooting common issues?

- **User Scenarios:**
  - User seeks information about available services.
  - User initiates a conversation seeking guidance on using InfoGuide.
  - User encounters a problem and seeks troubleshooting assistance.

#### 3. Conversation Flow:

- **Initiation:**
  - InfoGuide introduces itself and provides a brief overview of its capabilities.

- **User Queries:**
  - Systematically address user queries based on identified scenarios.
  - Implement a user-friendly navigation structure within the conversation flow.

- **Fallback Mechanism:**
  - If the chatbot encounters an input it doesn't understand, it politely seeks clarification or offers alternative suggestions.

#### 4. Response Configuration:

- **Intents:**
  - Define intents such as "Service Inquiry," "Getting Started," and "Troubleshooting."

- **Entities:**
  - Specify entities like "Service Type" and "Issue Category" to enhance response accuracy.

- **Dialog Nodes:**
  - Design dialog nodes to guide the conversation flow logically and efficiently.

#### 5. Platform Integration:

- **Facebook Messenger Integration:**
  - Follow Facebook Messenger's API guidelines for seamless integration.

- **Slack Integration:**
  - Implement the necessary configurations to ensure compatibility with the Slack messaging platform.

#### 6. User Experience:

- **Clear Prompts:**
  - Craft prompts that clearly guide users through available options and actions.

- **Informative Responses:**
  - Ensure responses not only answer queries but also provide additional relevant information.

- **Testing:**
  - Conduct extensive testing on both Facebook Messenger and Slack to identify and rectify any usability issues.

### Completion of Phase 1:

This completes Phase 1, providing a comprehensive understanding of the problem and a detailed design plan. The subsequent phases will involve implementing the designed chatbot, testing it in real-world scenarios, and making iterative improvements to enhance its effectiveness and user experience.
